                <h2>Puzzle Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the interaction I was assigned was "drag", I browsed some examples related to drag, and was
                    finally inspired by the picture of this simple puzzle game, then, I found a picture of a previous
                    project and cut it into six equal parts. Initially I used "dragable" to move the position of
                    different
                    images. But after I added adaptive viewport to the page, I encountered the first problem: the
                    adjusted images could not be arranged in the right place after the background size was changed. I
                    tried many methods but to no avail. Finally, I found an alternative method when browsing
                    "jqueryui.com/" - "sortable". In order to arrange the 6 images, I changed "display" to "grid", and
                    now the pictures can finally be arranged even after the page size is changed. Also, I made the board
                    draggable so user can adjust its position.

                <h2>Dragable Button</h2>
                <p>
                    I still needed an element that using "dragable", so I added a draggable button that can be clicked
                    to show/hide the puzzle game. I used fonts found on adobe fonts.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    The background is composed of two parts stacked. At front is a canvas created through p5.js, and
                    a rectangle of random size will appear constantly when the mouse is pressed. At back is a
                    randomly generated small square background that I made based on the random position examples. A
                    timer is used in js to loop through a function that changes the style of randomized squares every
                    seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I encountered some problems when setting elements as backgrounds, they always stack from top to
                    bottom
                    instead of front to back. After some research, I tried to integrate them into one element. By
                    changing their z-index, order, and "position:relative" and "position:absolute", I finally made them
                    overlap successfully.

                    The sound effect materials are all from pixabay.com. I added a background music and a click sound
                    effect to the button.
