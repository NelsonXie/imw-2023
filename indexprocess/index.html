                    I drew some sketches with reference to some personal homepages on the Internet and some initial
                    ideas. I want my homepage to look simple and comfortable. I plan to add horizontally scrolling
                    pictures of each item in a container, and jumping to
                    different items by clicking on it. Exercises/projects/readings can be switched through the top
                    buttons.

                <h2>Title & Icons</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="1.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="2.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="2.5.png" width="100%">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Firstly, I wrote the title and my name, then added an overlay and three buttons on top. I found the
                    website "fontawesome.com" very useful when working with icons for buttons. I just wrote "fa-solid
                    fa-list" and the button looks like this "list" icon. After that I added some animation to the
                    buttons, including hover, click, active-to increase the interactivity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Container</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="3.png" alt="back" width="100%">
                    <img src="4.png" alt="back" width="100%">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Then I added a box to display all my assignments for this semester. I added three containers and
                    made them show/hide when each button is clicked. At first I made it scroll horizontally, but
                    eventually considering that horizontal scrolling took more time and was inconvenient, I changed it
                    back to vertical scrolling and added an auto-scroll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took a screenshot of each assignment and put it into the container, and then added a title and
                    link to the assignment to each picture.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Others</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="5.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="6.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="7.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="8.png" width="100%">
                    <img src="9.png" width="30%">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Finally, I added a background to the index. I used array and random functions to display a random
                    background every time the page was opened. And added a horizontal scrolling animation to the
                    background image. Then I added background sounds and a music player, and added different click
                    sounds to the buttons, all from "pixabay.com".
